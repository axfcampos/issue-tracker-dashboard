NITD - Node.js Issue Tracker Dashboard
================


## tl;dr;
A simple dashboard to monitor issues on the [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node), assuring that everyone gets the deserved attention. Currently hosted at http://nitd.daviddias.me/

## Description


## How to contribute

This is an open source project, any PR is welcome, check the [issues here](https://github.com/diasdavid/nitd/issues), but most importantly, help the node core team by helping others that have questions/have opened issues on the node.js project. To see the ones that need attention, just open [nitd](http://nitd.daviddias.me/)

Also, we need some UI/UX help, currently it is not the friendliest thing ever :P
